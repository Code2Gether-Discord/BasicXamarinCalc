**Describe the feature you'd like implemented**
Use the Given-When-Then format when requesting a new feature.
The Given-When-Then formula is a template intended to guide the writing of acceptance tests for a User Story:

(Given) some context or condition
(When) some action or event occurs
(Then) a particular set of observable consequences or processes to perform

An example:

Given my bank account is in credit, and I made no withdrawals recently,
When I attempt to withdraw an amount less than my cardâ€™s limit,
Then the withdrawal should complete without errors or warnings
